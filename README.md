## Description

 This is the week two independent project for the Ruby class at Epicodus. In this project we are putting to practice our knowledge of working with classes as well as writing specs and integration with Sinatra. The objectives are as follows:

* Objects are created from a custom class with custom methods.
* An instance of one class appears in the method of another class.
* Sinatra routes process GET and POST requests/responses.
* Specs have complete coverage for the behaviors that need to be tested.
* Specs are passing.
* Logic is easy to understand.
* Code has proper indentation and spacing.
* Variable names are descriptive.
* Integration specs are passing.
* Sinatra application uses views, instance variables and forms.
* Good Git documentation (regular commits with clear, consistently formatted messages and a complete README).
* Message syntax should complete the sentence "This commit will..."; for example "update image files on the home page".
* README should include application name, author name, description, setup instructions, licensing.
* Application is deployed to Heroku (see link below).
